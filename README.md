# ðŸ§  TRANSFER LEARNING FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE CLASSIFICATION IN CHEST X-RAYS
  - A Comparative Analysis of Transfer Learning vs. a From-Scratch Approach

# Objectives
 - To prepare a comprehensive dataset of chest X-ray images for classification.
 - To establish a baseline by training a Custom CNN from scratch.
 - To implement and fine-tune a VGG16 model using Transfer Learning (VGG16 & ViT B/16).
 - To implement and fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT) model using Transfer Learning.
 - To conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of all three models on performance and efficiency.
